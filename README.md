Built an Amazon Clone Using ONLY HTML & CSS!
<br>
Self-challenging to create a clone of Amazon's layout using only HTML & CSS without JavaScript, the project helped improve my skills in responsiveness designing, layout building, and UI optimizing.
<br>
<br>
What I learned:
<br>
✅ Familiarizing myself with Flexbox & CSS Grid to create dynamic layouts
<br>
✅ Creating a responsive navigation bar with dropdown animations
<br>
✅ Creating a structured grid for products that fit any screen size
<br>
✅ Implementation of sticky header & footer for better UX
<br>
✅ Reusable & clean CSS coding
<br>
<br>
Tech Stack:
<br>
 HTML5 – semantic organization
 <br>
 CSS3 – Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries
 <br>
 <br>
What's Next?
<br>
I will be learning JavaScript
After learning of js, there are few bugs in my website and get to fix it out :)
